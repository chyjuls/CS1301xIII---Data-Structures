        # "David Beckham"]
        #
        # We sort it before doing anything so that later when we append
        # we are doing it in alphabetical order.

        # each loop to access the fullName

        # will always come first, and last name will
        # always be after. Note that fullName as of right now is a
        # string, so we split it to make it accessible per first and
        # last name.

            # empty list.
